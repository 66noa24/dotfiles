1. First thing you need to do is go [here](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) and get the `plug.vim` file and put it in the autostart file.
	- You can do that by clicking on `plug.vim` then clicking on view raw, then right-clicking, then save file.

2. Second open up vim, it will give an error this is ok, just continue. Then in nvim type `:PlugInstall` This will install all of the plugins, feel free to add and remove as needed
	- After it has installed exit and restart nvim, everything should be good!
